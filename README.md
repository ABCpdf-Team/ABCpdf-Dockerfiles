# ABCpdf Dockerfiles

This repo contains pipelines to build and push the most up-to-date images for our Docker Hub repositories.

You generally want [current images](https://hub.docker.com/r/abcpdf/mcr-aspnet) but we also keep [older repositories](https://hub.docker.com/u/abcpdf).


Fresh images are built each Tuesday at 3am UTC.



We scan each container with Trivy - a popular security scanner for cloud-native environments. Here are the [latest results](https://abcpdf-team.github.io/ABCpdf-Dockerfiles/).
